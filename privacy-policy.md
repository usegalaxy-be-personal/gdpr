## Information collected and use of information

During normal usage of our services we do not collect information that will personally identify you. Our webservers only store information such as the Referrer (where you came to us from), pages that you access, and dates of your visit. We may use this information in anonymised aggregates in order to generate usage statistics and to improve the usefulness of our services. All of this data is discarded after 24 hours.

Beyond this, we will only store personal information which you provide to us voluntarily (e.g. datasets uploaded to Galaxy, histories you create, etc.), or as part of a support request.

The information required to register with the Belgian Galaxy server and all uploaded data is solely used to offer the services provided by us. Username and email address are mandatory for registering with this service. This information is required to guarantee the legitimate use of the service and to prevent duplicate registrations abusing our quota system.

For the Belgian Galaxy server you can see all of the information we have stored related to your person and you have the right to correct this information at any time. You may do this by going to https://usegalaxy.be, clicking on "User" → "Preferences" → "Manage Information". You also have the right to retract your consent to use personal identifiable information at any time with effect for the future. An email to the address stated below is sufficient. We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above.
